I edit a lot of [CloudFormation](http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/). I use emacs to do this, but felt the experience could be a bit nicer. 

Right now this just does syntax highlighting, but I'd like it to be able to tab complete keywords in a template.

This is my first emacs mode, so I'm sorry if it sucks. Any feedback would be appreciated.
